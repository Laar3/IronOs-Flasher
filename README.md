# Install Options

#### Disclaimer: does not currently work on wayland.
1. Premade Binaries: currently only available for Linux x86 distros.

2. Build from Code: recommended for development or if you have MacOs or ARM device.

## <img width="17" src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/ArchLinux/4E5EE4" /> Arch based distros (Arch, Artix, Manjaro, Endeavor)

Head over to [releases](https://github.com/Spagett1/PineFlash/releases).

Download the latest .tar.zst file.

Then simply run.
```
sudo pacman -U ./pineflash-*-x86.tar.zst 
```

Make sure you have the needed [dependancies](https://github.com/Spagett1/PineFlash/releases) installed

Download the latest pineflash_linux_x86_<version>.zip file from the [releases page](https://github.com/Spagett1/PineFlash/releases).

Then extract and install it.
```
unzip ./pineflash_linux_x86_*.zip

## :building_construction: Build from code

This is the same PineFlash as the pre-made binaries [here](https://github.com/Spagett1/PineFlash/releases/). Install this if the binaries do not support your architecture or you have dev purposes.

## :bookmark_tabs: Build Dependancies


Install these if you don't have them (not needed if using the PKGBUILD).
```
git
rust
cmake
polkit
gtk3 (arch based distros) / libgtk-3-dev (debian based distros)
dfu-util - for pinecil V1 support
```

## :toolbox: Build option 1, handy scripts
 </summary>
 
Use the handy scripts will compile and install PineFlash for you.

(Sorry if you are on Mac you need to build it manually, find instructions for that [here](https://github.com/Spagett1/PineFlash/edit/master/README.md#man_factory_worker-build-option-2-manual-build))

## <img width="17" src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/Linux/4E5EE4" /> Build Linux from script.
1. To build from source code, first install build dependencies.
2. Extract the source code tar.gz from the newest Assets in [releases here](https://github.com/Spagett1/PineFlash/releases/)
3. Run the `generic_linux_install.sh` file which will build and install Pineflash.

## <img width="17" src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/archlinux/4E5EE4" />  Build on Arch based distro's
1. All dependancies will be handled by the PKGBUILD
2. You can use the PKGBUILD which will handle everything for you.
3. Just run `makepkg -si` in the main directory to build and install it.

## :man_factory_worker: Build option 2, manual build
 </summary>

Old school style, this is recommended if you have issues with the scripts or want to help develop PineFlash.
 
This is currently the only way to install on MacOs.
 
1. Install all the dependencies.

2. download the git submodules 
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
3. build blisp which is needed for pinecil V2 support 
```
cd blisp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DBLISP_BUILD_CLI=ON ..
cmake --build .
sudo mv ./tools/blisp/blisp /usr/bin/ #Or some other global path.
```
:dart: Important: Don't forget to add blisp to your path

4. Then build pineflash itself
```
cargo build --release
```
5. The resulting binary will be in `target/release/pineflash`, this can be moved into your path (`/usr/bin/pineflash`) or just run as a portable executable.

6. Then copy the Pineflash.desktop file to `/usr/share/applications` and copy `assets/pine64logo.png` to `/usr/share/pixmaps` for the shortcut to show up in launchers. (This does not apply to MacOs, you will have to run pineflash from the terminal for now, sorry.)

7. On linux, root permissions are needed for dfu-util and blisp if running from the terminal. In order to solve this you need to run the program with the following command  
`pkexec env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY XAUTHORITY=$XAUTHORITY pineflash`.   
If you use the Gui app, then don't worry about it. It's already in the .desktop file and not necessary.

## :runner: Run 

<img width="17" src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/Linux/4E5EE4" /> Linux: Pineflash should just appear in your app launcher.  
Alternatively, from the command line, run `pkexec env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY XAUTHORITY=$XAUTHORITY pineflash`

<img width="17" src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/Apple/4E5EE4" /> MacOS: simply running `pineflash` will work fine as it doesn't need root privledges. Sorry, no launcher icon yet.

 ## :electric_plug: Connect Pinecil to a PC

1. To do the firmware update, connect one end of a USB cable to the PC.
2. Then, hold down the `[-]` button **before** plugging the usb-c cable to the back of Pinecil.
3. Keep holding the `[-]` for ~10 seconds more before releasing the button. If you correctly entered flashing mode, the screen will be black/empty. If not, do it again, flip the cable, or try another cable, different port, or a different PC.
4. See [Pinecil Wiki](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Pinecil_Firmware) firmware details if you get stuck.
 
## :spiral_calendar: Todo

- [ ] Windows support.
- [ ] In app instructions for getting the pinecil ready to flash.
- [ ] Changing boot logo support.
- [ ] Improve UI (colors, design, workflow).
- [ ] Launcher icon for macos and an easier way to install it there.

## :tea: Feel like supporting me?

Well you can buy me a coffee, or rather tea bags or something since i dont drink coffee ;)
